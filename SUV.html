Review:
There's a lot to like about the CRV Touring model. But a couple things really surprised me - and not in a good way. I traded in my 10 year old Civic for this new top of the line CRV. I expected - silly me - that this car would have at least as much going for it as s 2006 Civic. Wrong. 1) on my old car, the "voice" icon button allowed me do all sorts of things - including change radio stations by voice command. With the new CRV, if you are in the GPS mode and you want to change to a specific radio station, you have to punch four buttons on different parts of the screen. Very unintuitive and difficult to do while driving. Why couldn't they at least install physical radio station buttons under the screen? You can use the "source" button and scroll through all your stations, but again, that means sometimes pushing 7 or 8 buttons just to change a damn radio station to the one you want. 2) The many (MANY!) setting displays for the dash are mostly superfluous and navigating through them is not easy. And I've yet to find one that prominently displays you speed -- again, a feature on the 10 year old Civic that worked well. Given that the speedometer is hard to read, there should be some other way to see how fast you're going. 3) The camera on the right side of the car for changing lanes and turning is great. But wouldn't one on the left side be even more useful? Why one on the right but none on the left? 4) The rear window is really hard to see out of, compared to many other comparable crossover makes and models. 5) Finally, I kick myself for not noticing that the storage compartments in the console and doors are teeny. Much smaller than the old Civic, and this is a much larger car. Is it too much to be able to carry a small pack of tissues, a pen, some change, a cell phone and tire gauge in your car?

Review:
Love the car. Hate the front seats. The bolster on either side is rigid and relatively high (pointed) compared to other bolsters so a big person sits "ON" the bolster instead of between the bolster. These high rigid bolsters press against the sciatic nerve making it very uncomfortable after about 20 minutes. Small people don't seem to have a problem. There is no way around it, even with cushions that ultimately defeat the value of the AC/Heated seats. Lexus customer (no) service told me if they have enough comments they will consider a design change in future vehicles but as for now, nothing they can/will do.
