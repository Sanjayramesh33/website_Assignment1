Review:
My first Titan was a 2008. I had that truck for 4 years. Never had any trouble with it, loved it. It was totaled when a larger truck ran a stop sign and T-boned my truck. I walked away, took the insurance money and purchased my 2012. 
This year, I traded, what I thought would be "up" to the 2015. 
The 2015 interior design on the doors had changed, and for the worse. Very upset. Calling the dealership again this morning, because the "new" door Assembly is separating worse than the original door they replaced. 
Poor design? Poor materials? Very disappointed. 
Curious how I will be received this morning when I once again call the Service Dept...

Review:
I live in Canada and the Elevation Edition just arrived for 2016. Great looking truck with the Elevation package. Tons of compliments. The engine provides just enough power for how i use the truck and the cylinder management works great. 

Shopped other trucks but no one else provides such a good looking truck in the same trim and price
